**Why am I getting HTTP response with status code 400 Bad Request?**

The server cannot process the request due to a client error (malformed syntax, wrong URL, etc.)

**Why am I getting HTTP response with status code 405 Method Not Allowed?**

The requested URL does not match the request type. For example you cannot make a GET request to a POST endpoint.
